   	<p> Culture is defined as the customs, art, society, and achievement of a particular group of people. It is a very complex idea that has many layers. My personal definition aligns pretty perfectly with that of the definition from a dictionary: culture is the society, norms and achievements of a particular community; however I also would like to add that culture is something that heavily influences every aspect of the person's life. Culture affects their beliefs, likes, and dislikes. It is what makes most of us, us  based on the culture we were raised in and the cultures we chose to include ourselves in we become ourselves. 
	</p>
	<p> A culture that I find particularly interesting in this regard is otomi culture.a indigious group that was based in the central plateau region of Mexico.The otomi culture still exists today with a few descendants who have continued the practices and beliefs of the otomi people despite most of them losing their native tongue.
	</p>
	<p> The language of the otomi people is otomi however not many otomi people still speak their native tongue. Most of the otomi people have lost their language and now speak spanish because of the spanish which took conquered old day mexico. However, that did not make them any less connected to their otomi roots.
The Otomí are Roman Catholic, and, although certain identifications between Christian figures and pre-Christian gods exist, the major religious rituals, myths, and ceremonies are basically Christian. 
The otomi’s diet commonly  consists of tortillas, fruits which they find are available around them and drinking pulque.the otomi  practice raising livestock and farming. Plants which they would commonly plant included corn, beans, and squash.

	<p> I chose the otomi culture because I personally have been wanting to learn more about the indigenous peoples of my country and so I took this as my opportunity to do so. As for why I picked the otomi people is because of the unique art form that is commonly practiced among the otomi people. This art form is embroidery. The embroidery of the otomi people is largely appreciated by many people. It became popular in the 1960s and became a new source of income for the otomi people  and is commonly connected to Mexican culture.
